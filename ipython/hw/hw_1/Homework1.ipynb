For example, we have the HTML page that lists the contributors to Facebook's [osquery](https://github.com/facebook/osquery) project that is hosted on [Github.com](https://github.com). In this case, all we are interested in are the contributors and how many commits each of them has. Given the HTML page in `\"data/osquery_contributors.html\"` you will sift through tons of irrelevant data so that you can build a useful data structure.\n",
